Hey there, I'm Sevvy‚Äîa coding maestro fluent in Turkish, German, and English, with a knack for turning lines of code into captivating stories. Picture this: at the tender age of 20, I left the comfort of Cologne, Germany, for the wild adventure of North America, armed with a passion for exploration that knows no bounds.

In the whirlwind of adapting to new languages and cultures, I became a seasoned traveler, language whiz (proficient in three!), student, and everyone's go-to friend. But beneath it all, my journey took a surprising turn. While my roots lay in finance and sales, the siren call of coding grabbed my attention.

Now, as a full-stack developer, I channel my financial savvy into creating projects that breathe life into pixels. Navigating the challenges of coding mirrors my path of embracing the unknown, turning obstacles into stepping stones. Coding isn't just about syntax; it's my second language, intertwining with the various languages I've picked up along the way. Just as I mastered new tongues, I thrive on the challenges of coding, transforming them into stepping stones.

My story is a vibrant tapestry of determination, adaptation, and endless curiosity‚Äîan ongoing adventure bridging the gap between languages, cultures, and the digital realm. Coding isn't just a skill; it's my way of translating passion into projects and embracing the transformative power of the unknown.
